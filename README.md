# Feed reader testing

If you want to test it, you should open the index.html file with your favorite browser. All the tests should pass without problems =)

We have diferent tests:

 1.'RSS Feeds': Chek if the rss are ok.
 2. The menu: Check if the menu works well.
 3. Initial Entries: Check if there is at least 1 entry.
 4. New Feed Selection: Check if it is a new selection.
